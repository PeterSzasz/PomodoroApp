# PomodoroApp
A simple pomodoro app in PyQt5.15. Custom appearance. Classic rounds. Weird sounds (with simpleaudio). Weirder look.

- Start/Stop buttons on GUI
- click slider or
- hit [space] to pause/un-pause
- CTRL-Q to Quit

TODO:
- config menu and config file
- maybe cli parameters
- even simpler controls or we need a mini state-machine
- sound handling should be in its separate class and thread
