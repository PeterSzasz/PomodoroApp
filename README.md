# PomodoroApp
A simple pomodoro app in PyQt5.15. Custom appearance. Classic rounds. Weird sounds (with simpleaudio).

- Start/Stop buttons on GUI
- [space] as pause/start

TODO:
- slider and/or counter of remaining time
- config menu and config file
- maybe cli parameters
- even simpler controls or we need a mini state-machine
- sound handling should be in its separate class
